# Rail-Buddy-App
This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js ) stack app which is an Indian Railways Information App which includes PNR status, Train Schedule as of now. The PNR status service that
I have used is from Rapid API for PNR status service. And for ther services, I have made custom backend made from Express.js and MongoDB and git Indian Railways data from data.gov.in.
